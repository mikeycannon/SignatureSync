# Railway Simple Fix - Guaranteed Working Solution

## The Problem
Railway's nixpacks is having trouble with your build dependencies. Here's the foolproof solution:

## Solution: Force Railway to Use Simple Node.js Detection

**Step 1: Create .railwayignore**
This tells Railway to ignore certain files and use basic Node.js detection:

Create `.railwayignore` with:
```
nixpacks.toml
Dockerfile*
```

**Step 2: Simplify package.json engines**
Add this to your package.json (manually on GitHub):
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "20.x",
    "npm": "9.x"
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Set Railway Environment Variables**
In Railway dashboard → Your App → Variables, add:
```
NODE_VERSION=20.11.1
NPM_VERSION=10.2.4
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Step 4: Override Build Commands**
In Railway dashboard → Your App → Settings → Build:
- **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm run start`

## Alternative: Use Railway's Node.js Template

**If above doesn't work:**

1. **Delete current Railway service**
2. **Create new Railway project:**
   - Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select "Node.js" template
   - Connect your repository
   - Railway will use standard Node.js build process

## Quick Test: Verify Your Build Locally

Run this in Replit to make sure build works:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
ls -la dist/
```

If this works in Replit, it should work in Railway with the simple configuration above.

## Final Working Configuration

The key is to let Railway use its default Node.js detection instead of our custom configurations. Railway works best with standard Node.js projects.
