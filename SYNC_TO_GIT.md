# Sync Local Version to Git Repository

Your local version is now working perfectly with template saving functionality. Here's how to overwrite your Git repository with the current local version:

## Quick Method (Recommended)

Run the sync script:
```bash
./scripts/sync-to-git.sh
```

## Manual Method

If you prefer to do it manually:

1. **Add all changes:**
```bash
git add .
```

2. **Commit with a descriptive message:**
```bash
git commit -m "Sync working version - template saving fixed

✓ Template saving functionality working
✓ SVG upload support added  
✓ Logo spacing controls implemented
✓ Mobile navigation improvements
✓ Authentication fixes for asset uploads"
```

3. **Force push to overwrite remote:**
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

**Note:** Replace `main` with your branch name if different.

## What's Been Fixed

The current working version includes:
- ✅ Template saving validation issues resolved
- ✅ SVG file upload support
- ✅ Logo spacing controls (0-50px slider)
- ✅ Mobile navigation across all pages
- ✅ Authentication headers for asset uploads

## Safety Notes

- `--force-with-lease` is safer than `--force` as it checks for new commits
- This will overwrite your Git repository with the current local version
- Make sure this is what you want before proceeding

Your template editor is now fully functional with all the requested features!
