# Export Your Working Code

Since you're experiencing Git errors, here are alternative ways to preserve your working code:

## Option 1: Download as ZIP (Recommended)

1. In Replit, go to the Files panel
2. Click the three dots menu (⋮) next to the project name
3. Select "Download as ZIP"
4. Extract the ZIP file to your local machine
5. Replace your Git repository contents with these files

## Option 2: Manual File Copy

Copy the key files that have been updated:

### Core Files to Copy:
- `client/src/pages/template-editor.tsx` (main template editor)
- `client/src/pages/templates.tsx` (templates list)
- `client/src/pages/assets.tsx` (assets page)
- `client/src/components/layout/topbar.tsx` (navigation)
- `server/routes.ts` (API routes)
- `server/storage.ts` (data storage)
- `shared/schema.ts` (database schema)

### New Files Added:
- `scripts/sync-to-git.sh` (sync script)
- `SYNC_TO_GIT.md` (sync instructions)

## Option 3: Direct Git Commands (if Git works locally)

If Git works in your local environment, run these commands:

```bash
# Initialize new repo if needed
git init

# Add remote (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>

# Copy all files from this working version
# Then run:
git add .
git commit -m "Working version - all features functional"
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## What's Working in This Version:

✅ **Template Saving**: Fixed validation issues, templates save successfully
✅ **SVG Upload**: Support for SVG files in logo uploads
✅ **Logo Spacing**: 0-50px spacing control with slider
✅ **Mobile Navigation**: Hamburger menu works across all pages
✅ **Authentication**: Asset upload authentication headers fixed
✅ **Real-time Preview**: Click-to-edit functionality with live updates
✅ **Font Customization**: 10 font families, 6 weight options

## Priority Files (Most Important):

1. `client/src/pages/template-editor.tsx` - Main editor with all features
2. `shared/schema.ts` - Database schema with proper validation
3. `server/routes.ts` - API endpoints for template operations

These contain all the bug fixes and new features that make the application fully functional.
